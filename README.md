## Overview
This project implements an interactive **Voting System** that allows users to cast votes for multiple candidates and display results efficiently. Inspired by real-world voting processes, the system offers an easy-to-use interface for managing votes and calculating results.

## Key Features
- **Voting Process**  
  Users can cast their votes by entering a number corresponding to their preferred candidate or choose to view the current vote tally. The application captures and updates votes dynamically, ensuring accurate tracking of participantsâ€™ selections.

- **Results Display**  
  Upon request, the system presents detailed voting results, including the number of votes each candidate received. It effectively communicates results through user-friendly messages.

- **Tie Handling**  
  The application includes logic to check for ties between candidates, providing clear messaging for scenarios where candidates receive equal votes. Users are informed whether there is a winner or if a tie exists among candidates.

- **Input Validation**  
  To maintain the integrity of the voting process, the system validates user input, rejecting invalid votes and prompting users for correct entries. This enhances the user experience and ensures data accuracy.

## Summary
The Voting System simplifies the voting experience while ensuring transparency and providing clear visual feedback on outcomes. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental programming concepts, including control flow, data handling, and user input management within an assembly language environment.
